[Assignment Website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

basic calculator written in html, css & javascript.

# basic requirements

basic operators: add, subtract, divide, multiply

operate function should take one operator and two numbers as arguments

TODO: add a change to style.css to check that it loads properly
TODO: implement operate function inside of script.js script
TODO: set up a layout of the right buttons in html (display, operators (\*/+-), numbers 0-9, equals =, clear) HTML
TODO: setup flexbox layout to create a grid for the buttons. CSS

# Extra credit:

TODO: add support for Floating numbers as input (add . button)
TODO: prettify css stuff (this project should be a bit nicer than the previous ones)
TODO: add a backspace button to undo mistakes
TODO: add keyboard support (possibly difficult, but I'm feeling this one)
