# Odin-calculator

[Assignment Website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

basic calculator written in html, css & javascript.

# Basic requirements

basic operators: add, subtract, divide, multiply

operate function should take one operator and two numbers as arguments

- TODO: add a change to style.css to check that it loads properly
- TODO: setup flexbox layout to create a grid for the buttons. CSS
- TODO: implement string to (number operator number) conversion (either in equals eventhandler, operator function or separate function)

# Extra credit:

- TODO: add support for Floating numbers as input (add . button)
- TODO: prettify css stuff (this project should be a bit nicer than the previous ones)
- TODO: add a backspace button to undo mistakes
- TODO: add keyboard support (possibly difficult, but I'm feeling this one)
